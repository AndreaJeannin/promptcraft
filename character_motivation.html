  <h1>Character Motivation</h1>
  
  <div class="definition">
    <strong>Definition:</strong> Character motivation encompasses the underlying psychological drives, desires, needs, and goals that compel a character to act and make decisions throughout a story. It serves as the engine of character behavior, explaining not just what characters do, but why they do it, making their actions believable and their journey compelling.
  </div>

  <div class="hierarchy-box">
    <h3>Motivation Hierarchy</h3>
    <p><strong>Surface Goals:</strong> What the character says they want (often conscious)</p>
    <p><strong>Deep Desires:</strong> What the character truly needs (often unconscious)</p>
    <p><strong>Core Drives:</strong> Fundamental psychological needs that fuel all behavior</p>
    <p><em>The tension between these levels creates internal conflict and character complexity.</em></p>
  </div>

  <h2>Types of Character Motivation</h2>
  
  <div class="motivation-type">
    <h3>External Motivation (Want)</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Conscious, concrete goals that drive the plot forward. These are often what the story appears to be about.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Specific, measurable, plot-driven, often obstacle-focused</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Find the treasure, win the competition, solve the murder, save the city, get revenge</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Provides clear story direction and measurable progress</p>
  </div>

  <div class="motivation-type">
    <h3>Internal Motivation (Need)</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Deep psychological or emotional needs that drive character growth. Often unconscious at the story's start.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Abstract, emotional, growth-oriented, often self-awareness focused</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Need for acceptance, overcoming fear, learning to trust, finding self-worth, accepting responsibility</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Creates character arc and thematic resonance</p>
  </div>

  <div class="motivation-type">
    <h3>Situational Motivation</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Immediate responses to current circumstances, often survival or reaction-based.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Temporary, reactive, context-dependent, often instinctive</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Escape danger, protect loved ones, respond to threats, seize opportunities</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Drives moment-to-moment action and creates tension</p>
  </div>

  <div class="motivation-type">
    <h3>Backstory Motivation</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Drives rooted in past experiences, trauma, or formative events that shape current behavior.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Historical, often unconscious, pattern-creating, emotionally charged</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Proving worth due to childhood neglect, avoiding intimacy after betrayal, seeking control after powerlessness</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Explains character psychology and behavioral patterns</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Motivation in Different Character Types</h2>
  <div class="examples">
    <h3>Classic Motivation Patterns</h3>
    <p><strong>The Hero:</strong> External goal (save the world) + Internal need (find courage/self-worth)</p>
    <p><strong>The Villain:</strong> Twisted motivation where means don't justify ends (power through destruction)</p>
    <p><strong>The Mentor:</strong> Altruistic motivation (guide others) often masking personal need (redemption)</p>
    <p><strong>The Anti-Hero:</strong> Selfish external goals that accidentally serve greater good</p>
    <p><strong>The Tragic Hero:</strong> Noble motivation undermined by fatal flaw or circumstances</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Literary Examples Analysis</h2>
  <div class="examples">
    <h3>Complex Motivation in Literature</h3>
    <p><strong>Hamlet:</strong> External: Revenge father's murder / Internal: Overcome indecision and moral paralysis</p>
    <p><strong>Elizabeth Bennet:</strong> External: Find suitable marriage / Internal: Overcome prejudice and pride</p>
    <p><strong>Gatsby:</strong> External: Win Daisy back / Internal: Escape his past and achieve impossible dream</p>
    <p><strong>Walter White:</strong> External: Provide for family / Internal: Assert power and feed ego</p>
    <p><strong>Katniss Everdeen:</strong> External: Survive the games / Internal: Protect those she loves while maintaining humanity</p>
  </div>

  <div class="warning-box">
    <h3>Common Motivation Pitfalls</h3>
    <p><strong>Generic motivations:</strong> "Save the world" without personal stakes</p>
    <p><strong>Unclear motivations:</strong> Character actions don't align with stated goals</p>
    <p><strong>Static motivations:</strong> Drives never evolve or deepen throughout story</p>
    <p><strong>Contradictory motivations:</strong> Multiple drives that don't create meaningful conflict</p>
    <p><strong>Weak motivations:</strong> Stakes too low to justify character's extreme actions</p>
  </div>

  <div class="prompt-examples">
    <h3>AI Prompt Examples</h3>
    <p><strong>Layered Motivation:</strong> "Create a character who wants to become a famous chef (external) but actually needs to prove they're worthy of their father's respect (internal)."</p>
    <p><strong>Conflicting Drives:</strong> "Develop a detective whose desire for justice conflicts with their need to protect their corrupt partner."</p>
    <p><strong>Hidden Motivation:</strong> "Write about someone who claims to help others but is actually trying to assuage their own guilt."</p>
    <p><strong>Evolving Motivation:</strong> "Show how a character's motivation shifts from revenge to redemption over the course of the story."</p>
    <p><strong>Backstory-Driven:</strong> "Create a character whose childhood abandonment drives them to become an overprotective parent."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ai-note">
    <h3>For AI Models</h3>
    <p>When creating character motivations, ask: What does the character want? What do they need? What are they afraid of? How do past experiences shape current behavior? Ensure external goals serve internal needs, and that motivations create both forward momentum and internal conflict. The best motivations are specific, personal, and have clear stakes. Remember that characters may not be consciously aware of their deepest motivations.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Building Believable Motivations</h2>
  <p><strong>Make it personal:</strong> Connect motivations to specific experiences, relationships, or fears.</p>
  <p><strong>Create stakes:</strong> Characters must have something meaningful to gain or lose.</p>
  <p><strong>Layer complexity:</strong> Combine multiple motivational levels that may conflict.</p>
  <p><strong>Show evolution:</strong> Motivations should deepen, shift, or be challenged throughout the story.</p>
  <p><strong>Ground in emotion:</strong> The strongest motivations are rooted in powerful feelings.</p>
  <p><strong>Test consistency:</strong> Every major character action should trace back to motivation.</p>
